# bergbuch: Robert Nystrom - Crafting Interpreters in Rust
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) (free web version) by Robert Nystrom is a great book about compiler construction. In this repository I'm working through the book, but instead of writing Part 1 in Java and Part 2 in C, I'll try to write both parts in Rust. I think this has some advantages:

- It prevents mindless copy-pasting and deepens understanding
- Rust

# Part 1
Part 1 is somewhat completed. You can run it or its test suite as follows.

```sh
cargo run [file.lox]
cargo test
```

# License
My code is licensed under MIT. If any significant (i. e. large enough to not be covered as a quote) parts of the book end up here, I do not intend to unlawfully relicense them.

# Contributions
Please work through the material yourself. Fixing small or stylistic errors would be fine though.
